A promethues client for node.js inspired by [github.com/siimon/prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client).

### Why?

I found that read prom-client code is hard for me and decide try create own library for own projects as experiment (at least now I even decide do not publish it on NPM). I also do not like some requirements in official Prometheus article [WRITING CLIENT LIBRARIES](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_clientlibs/) (like default collector registery) â€” so this library will not looks like official client libraries for Prometheus.
